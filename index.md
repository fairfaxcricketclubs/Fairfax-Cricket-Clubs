## Welcome to Fairfax Cricket Clubs

Fairfax Cricket Club was founded in April 1996 by four individuals who worked for the Fairfax County Government. They were Deepak Patel, Harish Patel, Hal Sheikh and Shakeel Yusuf. Spurred by the excitement of the 1996 World Cup, these individuals felt that Cricket could become a feature sport in the County.
